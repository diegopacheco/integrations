### DESCRIPTION

This is the SignalFx elasticserach plugin. Follow these instructions to install the Elasticsearch Python module for collectd. This will send data about Elasticsearch to SignalFx, enabling built-in Elasticsearch monitoring dashboards.

Use this plugin to monitor the following types of information from an Elasticsearch node:
  * node statistics (cpu, os, jvm, indexing, search, thread pools, etc..)
  * per-index statistics
  * cluster statistics

Original Elasticsearch Documentation https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index.html

### REQUIREMENTS AND DEPENDENCIES


#### Version information

| Software          | Version        |
|-------------------|----------------|
| collectd          | 4.9 or later   |
| Elasticsearch     | 1.0.0 or later |

### INSTALLATION

1. Install the Python plugin for collectd.

 ##### RHEL/CentOS 6.x & 7.x, and Amazon Linux 2014.09, 2015.03 & 2015.09

 Run the following command to install the Python plugin for collectd:
 ```
 yum install collectd-python
 ```
 ##### Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04, 15.04 & Debian 7, 8:

 This plugin is included with [SignalFx's collectd package](https://support.signalfx.com/hc/en-us/articles/208080123).

1. Download the Python module from the following URL:

 https://github.com/signalfx/collectd-elasticsearch

1. Download SignalFx’s [sample configuration file](https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/blob/master/collectd-elasticsearch/20-elasticsearch.conf).

1. Modify the configuration file as follows:

 1. Modify the fields “TypesDB and “ModulePath” to point to the location on disk where you downloaded the Python module in step 2.

 1. Provide values that make sense for your environment, as described [below](#configuration).

1. Add the following line to /etc/collectd.conf, replacing the example path with the location of the configuration file you downloaded in step 4:
 ```
 include '/path/to/20-elasticsearch.conf'
 ```
1. Restart collectd.

collectd will begin emitting metrics from ElasticSearch.

### CONFIGURATION

* set the cluster name. It is preferable to have a unique cluster name to be able to easily distinguish between clusters. This is usually the same as the cluster name in the ElasticSearch configuration file. This defaults to "elasticsearch".
* per-index and cluster statistics can be disabled. They are enabled by default.

### USAGE
