### DESCRIPTION

This tool is designed to run inside a Kubernetes cluster. After installation it will auto-discover cluster nodes and periodically query stats from them.

### INSTALLATION

You can clone and build the tool yourself, but the easiest way to install is to use a prebuilt docker image. Here is an example yaml file:

```
	apiVersion: v1
	kind: Pod
	metadata:
	  name: "test-scrapper"
	  labels:
	    app: "test-scrapper"
	spec:
	  containers:
	  - name: scrapper
	    image: "quay.io/signalfx/prometheustosfx:latest"
	    env:
	    - name: SFX_SCRAPPER_API_TOKEN
	      value: <API TOKEN>
	    - name: SFX_SCRAPPER_CLUSTER_NAME
	      value: <CLUSTER NAME>
	    - name: SFX_SCRAPPER_SEND_RATE
	      value: 5s
```
