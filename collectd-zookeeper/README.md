### DESCRIPTION

This is a collectd plugin for getting metrics and information from
[ZooKeeper](http://zookeeper.apache.org) servers. Based off the ZooKeeper monitoring script
[check_zookeeper.py](https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/zookeeper/trunk/src/contrib/monitoring/check_zookeeper.py).

### REQUIREMENTS AND DEPENDENCIES

This plugin requires:

| Python            |       2.6+     |
| Zookeeper         |       3.4.0+   |

 #### Note:
 - Requires ZooKeeper 3.4.0 or greater in order to use the `mntr` [four letter word command](http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/trunk/zookeeperAdmin.html#sc_zkCommands).
 - If support for earlier versions is needed, add `srvr` command, available in since 3.3.0, or `stat` (fetches extra uneeded data but available pre-3.3).
