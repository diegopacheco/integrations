### DESCRIPTION

This is the SignalFx Memcached plugin. Follow these instructions to install the Memcached plugin for collectd. This will send data about Memcached to SignalFx, enabling built-in Memcached monitoring dashboards.

Use this plugin to monitor the following types of information from a Memcached node:

* request information (including hits, misses & evictions)
* current connections
* net input/output bytes
* number of items cached
